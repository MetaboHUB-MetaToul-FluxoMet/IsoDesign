Quick start
============

In this section we will explain how to launch IsoDesign once it has been installed onto your system.

   * If you have already used IsoDesign and are looking for a more in-depth tutorial, check out the :doc:`tutorial` section.

Graphical user interface
--------------------------------------

To open the Graphical User Interface, type in a terminal (e.g. Anaconda Prompt if installed on Windows):

.. code-block:: bash

    isodesign

If you have installed the package in a specific environment, make sure to activate it before starting IsoDesign.

IsoDesign interface will open in a new browser window :

Select your network file (which have a ".netw" extension. it a tsv file, see Tutorial for more details). 
An output directory path is set by default, but you can change it if you want. Then, click on the "Submit" button to load your model.
Once you submitted, a new section appears with differents elements of the model displayed in different tabs. 
This section allows you to check the elements of your model. If all elements are good, click on the "Next page" button.

On the next page, you can choose the isotopic composition of the substrates you want to simulate. 
For the simulation, it is necessary to configurate at least one form for each substrate and the total proportion of configured substrates must be equal to 100.
By default, one form is already configured for each substrate. You can remove it or add new ones but the total proportion must be equal to 100.
To configure a new form, choose lower and upper bounds for each atom of each metabolite. Enter the desire number of intervals. 
By default, the lower and upper bounds are set to 0 and 100 respectively. The number of intervals is set to 10. You can modify these values
and click on enter. The step is indicated. Click on "Add" button to add the form. You can see the form added in the table on the right.
Then, click on the "Submit" button to generate all the possible combinations.

You can see the combinations generated by clicking on the 'show combinations' button. 
You can remove some combinations if you want and reingrate them 
by clicking on the 'reintegrate' button. If all its well, you can click on "Submit for simulations".

On the next page, you can choose the influx mode you want to use (influx_s or influx_i).
Some options are already configured by default. You can remove them or add new ones. 
Then, click on the "Start simulation" button to start the simulation.

If the calculation is to long, you can stop it by clicking on the "Stop simulation" button. And you can restart it by clicking on the "Start simulation" button.

Once the simulation is done, you switch on the "Results" page. Here you can filter the results table... 
and apply criteria. You can add a new score and/or export your data.

.. note:: The process is continuously and automatically saved as a pickle file (".pkl") in the output folder. To reopen the current processing state, just reopen this file by clicking on "Load a processing file - Browse files" on the side bar at the left.

.. warning:: IsoDesign overwrites (results and processing) files if they already exist. So take care to copy your results elsewhere or to change the output path and/or filename if you want to protect them from overwriting.


Library
-------

IsoDesign is also available as a library (a Python module) that you can import directly in your Python
scripts:

.. code-block:: python

  import isodesign

.. seealso::  Have a look at our :ref:`API <Library documentation>` if you are interested in this feature.
