Tutorial
========
This tutorial will guide you through the main steps of IsoDesign, from the input of a metabolic network model to the analysis of simulation results.

Required input data files
------------------------
IsoDesign uses a specific file format, introduced in influx_si, to describe metabolic network models: the Multiple TSV File (MTF) format.  
MTF files are tab-separated files (TSV), each with a specific role in model characterization. Each file is identified by a distinct suffix
indicating the type of information it contains. For more details on these files, please refer to the `influx_si software documentation 
<https://influx-si.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#>`_. 

IsoDesign uses a network file (with the “.netw” extension) as input. After submitting the input file, all associated MTF format files sharing 
the same model name are automatically loaded. A new section, "Network Analysis", then appears, presenting multiple tabs for exploration.
