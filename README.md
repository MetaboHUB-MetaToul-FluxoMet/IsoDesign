# IsoDesign
The objective of IsoDesign 2.0 is to provide simple and rapid 13C tracer design. Leveraging the influx_si software and through iterative minimization of in silico calculated fluxes standard deviations (SD), IsoDesign 2.0 will help researchers in selecting the best compromise between flux precision and tracer prices.
